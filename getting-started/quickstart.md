### Getting started with GaiaHub AI

The GaiaHub platform offers a seamless way for developers to integrate state-of-the-art LLM models into their applications and production workflows with just a few bocks using the builder. Our builder is available through our platform. To enable your applications, you need to activate payments on your account. Within moments, you'll be able to use our builder:

An application is composed by blocks that represent the components of your application. After [setting up your OpenAI's credentials](adding-credentials.md), you can connect for example a ChatGPT block to a Conversation Chain and create your first app:
