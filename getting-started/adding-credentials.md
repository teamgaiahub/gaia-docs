# Adding credentials

In order to connect to external services you need to add the credentials of those services to your GaiaHub's credentials list. So you'll be able to use it later in the service's blocks of your applications on the platform.

To do that, you just need to go to "Main menu >> Credentials >> Create New Credential"

Then, you select the credential type. It can be a LLM service like ChatGPT, database, etc

By last but not least, you will need to set a name and the credential key:

Now, hit enter and it's done! You've added your first credential!
