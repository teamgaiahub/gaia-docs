# Variables

GaiaHub offers variables as a way to share information across your applications. For example, you could have a application summarising the important notes from a website in real time, and putting the results in a global variable that would later be read and used by another application.

To create your variables it's easy. You need to go on the left menu "Variables" > "Create New Variable":

Then, you'll set the variable's name and its type:

* **Static:** the value will be retrieved as it is
* **Runtime:** the value will be retrieved from the .env file
